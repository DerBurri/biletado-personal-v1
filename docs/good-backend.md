# How to write a good backend
if you have technical questions, feel free to open a issue in [biletado/biletado.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/biletado/biletado.gitlab.io/-/issues)

## API v1
* select your API to start with
* each API has at least one request to the other one
* each API needs to check for authentication on some methods
* authorization will not be checked
* feel free when choosing programming languages or frameworks
* you may check the authentication via middleware, this includes maybe traefik
* you are not forced to use the equipped postgres-database as long as the API reacts like demanded
    * include your db-engine in the compose-environment

## what to pay attention

### containers
* Pack your software inside a container so others can easily start your software in their own environments.
* adjust your copy of [`biletado/compose/compose.yaml`](https://gitlab.com/biletado/compose/-/blob/main/compose.yaml)
  by your needs.
* [keep your containers simple, stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). The smaller your runtime
  container is the smaller is the amount of potential security issues (i.â€¯e.Â use a build-container to create the
  runtime-image)
* choose good base-images
    * good choices are e.â€¯g.Â [official docker-images](https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image&image_filter=official),
      the ones built by [bitnami](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnami) or
      official images of your softwaredeveloper like [bazelbuild](https://hub.docker.com/u/bazelbuild) for [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)

### script everything
* create scripts for automated creation of your images, best is to use CI-integration like gitlab-ci or GitHub Actions
* `docker build` is not always the way to go, some frameworks like quarkus have their own way to build container-images

### choose your framework wisely
* use established web-frameworks which are designed for creating APIs
* probably some good ones are
    * [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) (PHP)
    * [Laminas](https://getlaminas.org/) (PHP)
    * [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) (Java/Kotlin)
    * [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (Java/Kotlin)
    * [Golang](https://go.dev/) stdlib (Go)
    * [Gin Web Framework](https://gin-gonic.com/) (Go)
    * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-[Frameworks](https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/frameworks/)
    * [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (Python)
    * [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) (Ruby)
    * [Dart](https://dart.dev/)-[Frameworks](https://medium.com/flutter-community/web-server-frameworks-for-dart-197a073299eb)
    * [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-[Frameworks](https://www.masteringbackend.com/posts/top-5-typescript-frameworks)
* not so good ones are
    * PHP StdLib
    * Perl oneliners
    * javascript in general (IMHO)

### secure your Queries
* use always prepared statements to prevent SQL-Injection
* use an ORM or ODM for faster development

### clean code
* you are writing the legacy code of tomorrow, write it careful
* in half a year your own code is as far away from yourself like to any co-worker
* write self-documenting code
    * small classes and methods
    * good method- and variable-names
* use consistent code-style
* this means sadly, you should not use assambler, [Brainfuck](https://www.bf.doleczek.pl/), [2k16](https://github.com/HerrLevin/2k16-spec)Â (ðŸ˜ž)
  or most other [esoteric languages](https://esolangs.org/)

### validate the JWT
* load the public-key from the id-provider and check if the JWT is applicable and has a valid signature

### tracing
* respect the tracing-header and reuse it for further requests so that the spans can be followed when requesting through
  traefik
* have a look at how to implement tracing inside your application

### configurability
* make your software and container-images configurable so that they can run in different environments
    * this can be by environment-variables or config-files which can be mounted into the container
    * e.â€¯g.Â the database-connection parameters or the HTTP-endpoints where requests are getting send to

### compose-environment
adjust the compose-environment that your own backend runs inside.

### licensing
* choose a appropriate license for your software to make it easy for others to reuse your code
    * e.â€¯g.Â MIT or BSD-2-clause

### version-control
* use the version-control-system of your choice to make it easy to collaborate
* if you choose the right one, you get a container-registry and CI/CD for free

### write documentation
* document your project, especially your configuration-parametes and how to use your container
* a readme-file inside the code-repository is always a good choice

### testautomation
* include some tests inside your CI/CD-process, e.â€¯g.Â unit-tests, linting and/or automated API-Tests
* test your project before or after building and don't deliver it if the tests fail

### logging
* write useful logs to stdout and stderr with different, configurable loglevels to help yourself and other developers
  when debugging
* worth to have a look at: [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html)

### ah, and implement the API
* CRUD-Operations
* Do good input-validation _before_ communicate with other APIs or Databases
* use always descriptive return values, i.â€¯e.Â choose the right HTTP-Status and return meaningful errormessages if
  necessary
